# Quick Overview

## What Elastic Beanstalk Does

Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of 

* capacity provisioning, 
* load balancing, 
* scaling, 
* application health monitoring 

of an application. 


!SLIDE

# Elastic Beanstalk Demonstration

* The Instructor will demonstrate creation of an Elastic Beanstalk managed web application. 
* After the demo the various parts will be explained
* Instructions on how to recreate the demo will be provided


!SLIDE

# Commands Used in the Demo

* Before the demo a quick overview of the commands used

!SLIDE

# Install the EB CLI

* The CLI is a python based command line interface to EB
  * **note** this step has already ran and will not be part of the demo

```
pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user
```

!SLIDE

#  Verify EB CLI install

```
eb --version
```
## Returns

```
EB CLI 3.14.6 (Python 3.6.6)
```


!SLIDE

# Create a Directory and CD into it


## Create Directory

```
$ mkdir HelloWorld 
```

## Switch to that directory


```
$ cd HelloWorld 
```

!SLIDE

# Initialize the directory for EB use


```
eb init 
```

## Creates hidden directory with config info


!SLIDE

# Verify directory contents

# Create Web Page

## Create index.html with "Hello World"

```
$ eb init -p PHP 
$ echo "Hello World" > index.html 
```


!SLIDE

# Launch App and Connect

## **eb create** deploys app to aws
## **eb open** launches web browser at app's url


<pre>
```
$ eb create dev-env  
$ eb open 
```
</pre>


!SLIDE

# Benchmark the App and close 

## Apache Bench **ab** is a simple benchmarking tool that comes with apache webserver


<pre>
$ ab -n 10 -c 2 http://www.somewhere.com/ 
$ eb terminate 
</pre>

!SLIDE

# EB demo



eb init -p PHP

It will ask for a region, I chose use-east-1

It will ask for credentials, 

```
you must provide your credentials.
